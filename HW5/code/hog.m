function ohist = hog(I)
%
% compute orientation histograms over 8x8 blocks of pixels
% orientations are binned into 9 possible bins
%
% I : grayscale image of dimension HxW
% ohist : orinetation histograms for each block. ohist is of dimension (H/8)x(W/8)x9
% TODO

% normalize the histogram so that sum over orientation bins is 1 for each block
%   NOTE: Don't divide by 0! If there are no edges in a block (ie. this counts sums to 0 for the block) then just leave all the values 0.
